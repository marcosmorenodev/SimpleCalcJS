-Pretty self-explanatory. Can perform basic arithmetic operations such as add, subtract, multiply and divide; only works with 2 numbers (both can be floats), each one made of user's desired length.
This is achieved with a method similar to string concatenation. It is done taking advantage of default array conversion made by JS, this is further explained in the code with a comment.

Known limitations: The first number cannot be negative and, as stated before, can't perform operations longer than 2 numbers at a time.
